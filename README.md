Based on the D3 code from Mike Bostock: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7607535

At the moment this is a simple working example with not many options

Note your highest level MUST!!! have '-' as a parent as with all the other Qlikview hierarchy extensions

If in doubt, a sample QVW file is included which has a basic inline hierarchy so you can see how it works
